Variables Vary

Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).

For example, this code prints 20:

acceleration = 10
acceleration = 20
print(acceleration)

The line acceleration = 20 reassigns the value of acceleration to 20. It overwrites whatever was being held in the acceleration variable before (10 in this case).

Assignment

We need to reduce our hero's health as they take damage.

Before each print() function in the provided code, change the value of player_health to 100 less than it was before.

The final output should look like this:

900
800
700
600

'''
CODE

player_health = 1000

# reduce by 100 here

print(player_health)

# and here

print(player_health)

# and here

print(player_health)

# and here

print(player_health)

'''

#Resolution

player_health = 1000

player_health = 900

print(player_health)

player_health = 800

print(player_health)

player_health = 700

print(player_health)

player_health = 600

print(player_health)
