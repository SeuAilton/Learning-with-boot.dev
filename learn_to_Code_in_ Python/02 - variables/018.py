Assignment

Competitive Fantasy Quest players – Ballan's Ballers – have won all their games in the elimination round of the tournament. They're now in the finals! Calculate the average score of their 4 games and store it in the average_score variable.

The average (or "mean") is calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by how many numbers there are. Which means first we need to add up all the scores, then divide by 4.

Search for the concept you'll need for this lesson, maybe "python math" or "order of operations"
