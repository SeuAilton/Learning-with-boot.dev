Variable Names

Variable names can not have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, Guido van Rossum, implores us to use snake_case for variable names. What is snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

Name 	       Description       Code 	     Language(s) that 
                                           recommend it

Snake Case  All words are  num_new_users  Python, Ruby, Rust
            lowercase and 
            separated               
            by underscores

Camel Case  Capitalize the  numNewUsers   JavaScript, Java
            first letter of 
            each word except 
            the first one

Pascal Case Capitalize the  NumNewUsers   C#, C++
            first letter of 
            each word         

No Casing   All lowercase   numnewusers   don't do this
            with no 
            separation      

To be clear, your Python code will still work with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

"If you won't use snake case for you, do it for me. I beg you."
