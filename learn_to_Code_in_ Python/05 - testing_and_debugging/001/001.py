Unit Tests

Up until this point, all the coding lessons you've completed have been testing you based on your code's console output (what's printed). For example, a lesson might expect your code (in conjunction with the code we provide) to print something like:

Armor: 2
Health: 18

If your code prints that exact output, you pass. If it doesn't, you fail.

Assignment

Complete the total_xp function. It accepts two integers as input:

  *level
  *xp_to_add

There are 100 xp per level. total_xp should convert the current level to xp, then add this current xp to the xp_to_add argument and return the player's total xp. For example:

  *If a player is level 1 and gains 100 xp, they have 200 total xp.
  *If a player is level 2 and gains 250 xp, they have 450 total xp.
  *If a player is level 170 and gains 590 xp, they have 17590 total xp.


"The pass keyword is a way to tell Python to do nothing. You'll need to replace it with your own code."

Tips

    *Take a look at the main_test.py file at the top of your editor. You can read the tests but you can't edit them.

    *If a lesson expects a returned value, make sure to always return a value, or else you may encounter some cryptic NoneType errors.
