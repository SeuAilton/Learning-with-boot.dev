Order of Functions

All functions must be defined before they're used.

You might think this would make structuring Python code hard because the order of the functions needs to be just right. As it turns out, there's a simple trick that makes it super easy.

Most Python developers solve this problem by defining all the functions in their program first, then they call an "entry point" function last. That way all of the functions have been read by the Python interpreter before the first one is called.

"Conventionally this "entry point" function is usually called main to keep things simple and consistent."

def main():
    health = 10
    armor = 5
    add_armor(health, armor)

def add_armor(h, a):
    new_health = h + a
    print_health(new_health)

def print_health(new_health):
    print(f"The player now has {new_health} health")

# call entrypoint last
main()
